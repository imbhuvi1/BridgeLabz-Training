# Welcome to the daily updates of Refresher Training

## Day 1 — DBMS Fundamentals & RDBMS Basics

### 📌 DONE TODAY (31/07/26)

- Learned the foundational hierarchy: **Data → Database → DBMS → RDBMS**
- Compared **File Systems vs DBMS**, and understood DBMS advantages (reduced redundancy, integrity, security, concurrency)
- Explored **types of DBMS** (Hierarchical, Network, Relational, Object-Oriented, NoSQL)
- Deeply understood **RDBMS features**, and made the critical **SQL vs NoSQL** decision framework
- Installed **MySQL** on Windows, understood its **internal architecture** (Connection → SQL → Storage Engine layers)
- Practiced **DDL** (CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE, RENAME) and **DML** (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
- Got introduced to **TCL** (COMMIT/ROLLBACK) and **DCL** (GRANT/REVOKE)
- Built the first two tables of our Health Clinic Database: `patients` and `doctors`
- Went through and answered all the practice and interview questions for the day.

## Day 2 - ER Diagram, Indexing, Database Normalization

### 📌 DONE TODAY (03/08/26)
- Learned formal **ER Diagram** components: Entity, Attribute, Relationship, Cardinality,
Participation, Primary/Foreign Keys
- Designed the **complete ER Diagram** for the Health Clinic Application, resolving the
Doctor ↔ Specialization M:N relationship via a junction table
- Deep-dived into **Indexing**: B+ Tree internals, Clustered vs Non-Clustered, Composite
(leftmost prefix rule), Unique, and Covering indexes
- Used `EXPLAIN` to measure real performance impact of indexes
- Covered **Normalization** from 1NF → BCNF, fixing update/insertion/deletion anomalies via
functional dependency analysis
- Learned **Denormalization** as a deliberate, targeted performance trade-off for
OLAP/reporting systems
- Built the **fully normalized Health Clinic schema** with proper indexes.
- Went through and answered all the practice and interview questions for the day.

## Day 3 — SQL Joins, Stored Procedures, Triggers

### 📌 DONE TODAY (04-08-2026)

- Moved from single-table queries to combining data across multiple related tables using all major JOIN types: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, SELF, and CROSS JOIN
- Wrote real multi-table joins across the normalized Health Clinic schema (Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Billing, Visit History) to pull meaningful combined reports
- Learned why MySQL doesn't natively support FULL OUTER JOIN, and how to simulate it using UNION
- Practiced Multiple Table Joins, chaining several JOIN clauses into one full appointment report query
- Learned Stored Procedures — precompiled, reusable SQL logic stored inside the database itself
- Practiced creating and calling procedures using DELIMITER, and working with IN, OUT, and INOUT parameter types
- Implemented Error Handling in procedures using DECLARE ... HANDLER, paired with transactions (COMMIT/ROLLBACK)
- Learned Triggers — automatic database actions that fire in response to INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE events
- Built BEFORE and AFTER triggers for INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE, understanding the NEW vs OLD row distinction
- Built the Appointment Procedure, Billing Procedure, Visit History Trigger, and Audit Trigger for the Health Clinic project — to be reused directly in Day 4's final JDBC application
- Went through and answered all the practice and interview questions for the day
